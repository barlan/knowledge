## Concepts
- ðŸŽ¯ Relentlessly drive for the "WIIFM?"
  - _Ask:_ What problem does this information solve for the audience?
  - _Answer with_: Benefits, not features
- Simplify
  - What are the essential ideas?
  - Use metaphors and relate concepts to what people already know
- Optimize for the rule of three

## Mechanics
- Key phrase(s)
  - Use literary devices to make them easy to remember
- Word choice
  - Use common terms (eschew a variegated vocalulary ðŸ˜‰)
  - Remove unncessary words
  - Avoid acronyms
  - Avoid jargon
